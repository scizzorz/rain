# Rain

A dynamically-typed, whitespace-delimited, garbage-collected language focused
on simplicity, expressiveness, and extensibility via a powerful C API.

Check out the [docs](https://scizzorz.github.io/rain/) for more.

## Dependencies

Definitely Python 3. Maybe some other things.

## Having fun

Make a fun Rain file:

    print("Wow, I'm having so much fun right now!")

And then sit and wait for the tool chain to be usable.
